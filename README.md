# vcfpgs
GWAS (VCF,PGS) risk calculator

Pseudo code:

Def VCFPGS():
	
	READ VCF
	
	FETCH PGS scores 
	
		For each PGS extract snps from vcf and summation of betaâ€™s x effect alleles
	
		Store risk for each PGS_id
	
	RETURN report/visual of PGS for each cancer/trait 


To do:
 1. Determine how to read and parse gzipped VCF, while optimizing the memory required to decompress.
